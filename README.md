# Bassenji

An utility to get a set of unique conformations 
from a molecular dynamics trajectory computing 
their populations from their occurrence in the trajectory.

The selection (at least at this moment) is based on RMSD.

## Input formats
* multi-molecular XYZ file
* PDB file (to be implemented)

## Output formats
* multi-molecular XYZ file 
(second string contains normalized population)
* separate XYZ files + population file (to be implemented)

This is majorly a learning project, so it may not work as intended or not work at all.
